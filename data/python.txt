Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. 
Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant indentation. 
Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects. 
Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured, object-oriented, and functional programming. 
It has a dynamic type system and automatic memory management. 
Pythonâ€™s extensive standard library and vast ecosystem of third-party packages make it one of the most popular languages in the world today.
