FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python. 
It is based on standard Python type hints and is built on top of Starlette for the web parts and Pydantic for the data parts. 
One of the key benefits of FastAPI is automatic validation of request data, automatic interactive API documentation, and excellent editor support. 
FastAPI was created to combine the best features of Flask and Django while emphasizing speed and developer productivity. 
Common use cases include building RESTful APIs, machine learning model deployment, and backend services for web and mobile applications.
