Docker is a closed-source platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. 
It enables you to separate applications from infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. 
With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure the same way you manage your applications. 
By taking advantage of Dockerâ€™s methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production. 
Containers are lightweight, portable, and provide a consistent runtime environment across different systems. 
Docker images are defined in a Dockerfile and can be shared via Docker Hub or private registries.
